Cannot Unify the types: Int,Int-$(1)->t1



Since the parser was not able to recognize the operator "%" so it just removed that from the expression and the last statement became

let a = 5 in
let b = 5 in
let c = a b in 
c

a and b has the type Int but in the statement c = a b, the program treats 'a' as a function application with argument 'b' and gets the type 'Int-${1}->t1'. Then it tries to unify the existing 'Int type' with 'Int-${1}->t1' and the program fails.
